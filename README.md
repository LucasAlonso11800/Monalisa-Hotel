# Monalisa Hotel

Inspired by a design I found online, I built a website for a fake 5-stars luxurious hotel set in Amalfi, Italy. A place I'd like to visit one day. The user can find information about all the different types of rooms, read testimonials about the hotel and finally book a room.

I built this project with NextJS, Typescript, SASS and MySQL. Tested with Jest and Cypress.
